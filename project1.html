    <div class="main">
        <div class="description">
            The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents.  HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em>

            Concepts of the Web:
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <ul>
                <li>Browser - a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web</li>
                <li>Internet - the world's largest computer network</li>
                <li>HTTP - the main protocol of the web</li>
                <li>Servers - computers that host the files that make up the web</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">
            HTML is made up of:
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <ul>
                <li>Text content - <em>what you see</em></li>
                <li>Markup - <em>what it looks like</em></li>
                <li>References to other documents - i.e. images, videos</li>
                <li>Links to other pages </li>
            </ul>

            Tags and Elements
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>
                HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>.  An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing <b>tags</b>.
                Some elements also have <b>attributes</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
            </p>
        </div>

            <table class="elements">

    <h1>Web Pages, Documents, and Structure</h1>
    <div class="main">
        <ul>
            <li>
                HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) files controls the structure of a web page.
            </li>
            <li>
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets ) files controls the style of a page (how it looks)
            </li>
            <li>
                Javascript is the interactive component.

        <div class="description">
            HTML is the language of the web.  It has specific syntax and rules.  The basic word in the language of HTML is a tag.
            The browser turns HTML tags into elements that form a tree (elements can have other elements within).
            It knows how to do that because of the DOM (Document Object Model) which is the standard convention
            for representing and interacting with HTML elements.
            Every element in a web page is a box.
            <p>
                CSS  use specific syntax and rules that change how elements look in the page, i.e. font-size, color, border, etc.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">
            There are three ways to include CSS Styling in a web page.
        </div>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Write CSS in the "head" section. This method is good for very small projects.
            </li>
            <li>
                Link the HTML page to a separate CSS file. This adds another step but is more organized when working on larger projects.
            </li>
            <li>
                Write the style "inline" with the HTML page. This should be avoided because it leads to lots of repeated codes.
                The same styles are copied and pasted into many elements.
                When changes are required, rewriting the codes can  lead to errors.  <b>Repetition should be avoided.</b>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="subtitle">
            Creating & Designing a Page:
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            Write the code, compare against design mock-up, refine code until it looks like the design. Get the structure of the page right.
            Visualize the boxes. work on the tags, size and position of the boxes.
            Use developer tools to refine the page without actually changing the codes until it meets the specification.
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">
            Code, Test, Refine
        </div>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Look for natural boxes
            </li>
            <li>
                Look for repeated styles and semantic elements
            </li>
            <li>
                Write the HTML page
            </li>
            <li>
                Apply styles (from biggest to smallest)
            </li>
            <li>
